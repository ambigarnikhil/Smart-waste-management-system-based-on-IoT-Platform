<p id="description">Many metropolitan cities produce tons of waste every day so efficient methods for collection and disposal are crucial. To make people's lives happier safer and healthier we developed an IoT prototype. The Internet of things (IoT) plays a vital role in connecting human life with machines and the internet. We developed a collection management system by fixing our prototype onto the dustbins and now they can be called Smart Bins. Our IoT prototype consists of a sensor microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. It collects data from sensors and passes it to the cloud via the internet. It measures the filled levels of the waste bins if the bins are full then it sends an alert message to the organization/controller stating ‚ÄúBin is completely filled‚Äù and it also predicts the future levels of the bin.</p>

We propose a smart waste management system by developing an IoT prototype that collects data(filled level) from the sensors and passes it to the Thingspeak cloud via the internet for storage and processing purposes. Our module collects data every hour and passes it to the cloud. Every day the organization/controller receives the update about the filled levels of the dustbins. One key feature is we implemented future predictions based on the previous data. Based on the historical data we can say at what instance of time the dustbin gets filled on a particular day<p>https://github.com/ambigarnikhil/Smart-waste-management-system-based-on-IoT-Platform/blob/main/DUST-BIN.jpg</p>
